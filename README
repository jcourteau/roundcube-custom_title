Custom Title

Super basic plugin to add custom prefix and suffix to your page titles.
You can already add a basic bit of text to your titles using
$rcmail_config['product_name'] but this way allows you to put usernames
and other more dynamic stuff in there.

Enable the plugin in config/main.inc.php and add your desired prefix
and suffix to the plugin's config file.
